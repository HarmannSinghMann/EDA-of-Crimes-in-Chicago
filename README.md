## Analysis of Crimes in Chicago
This repository contains the code and data for the project "Analysis of Crimes in Chicago". The project was completed under the curriculum of Master of Science in Data Science in the course MSDSP-430, named Python for Data Science.
### Course Description
The course MSDSP-430 provides a comprehensive introduction to the core features of the Python programming language. The course demonstrates fundamental concepts in computer science, including data representation strategies and implementation of data structures in Python. Students learn about tools for data science and software engineering and work on data analysis problems employing various programming paradigms such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, and data stream processing. The course also pays special attention to the standard Python library and packages for analytics and modeling.
### Project Description
The project "Analysis of Crimes in Chicago" is a data analysis project that aims to explore the crime trends in Chicago over the past few years. The project utilizes the data on crimes reported in Chicago from 2001 to present, available from the Chicago Police Department's website. The project involves data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, and data analysis using Python and various Python packages.
